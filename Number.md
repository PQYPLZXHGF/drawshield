# Description #

Numbers are used to specify how many charges are to be placed, and in some cases specify how many of a particular
feature are present.

## Numbers ##

The following numbers (or number specifiers) are recognised:

**a**, **an**, **one**, **two**, **three**, **four**, **five**, **six**, **seven**, **eight**, **nine**, **ten**,
**eleven**, **twelve**, **thirteen**, **fourteen**, **fifteen**, **sixteen**, **seventeen**, **eighteen**,
**nineteen**, **twenty**, **a pair**, **a couple**, **a dozen**, **a half dozen**, **a score**.

You can also just use the digits instead.

**the** is an acceptable subsititute for one, as for example in

```
Azure, the letter 'A' gules
```

## Back References ##

Heralds do not like to repeat themselves in the blazon and so will sometimes use "back references" to a
previous number. Wherever a number is expected you may use either of:

  * **as many**
  * **so many**

Obviously it is an error to refer to a previous number without having used one.
