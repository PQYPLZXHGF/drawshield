# Introduction #
The pages in this section list all the heraldic terms that are understood by the drawshield
program. It is intended for those already familiar with blazons, if you are
new to heraldry look at my [suggested reading](http://www.karlwilcox.com?page=shield).

In the pages of this section the following conventions have been used:

  * Everything in **bold** is a term that the program understands.
  * Items in round brackets are synonyms for the preceding word.
    * Common variations in spelling are also accepted (e.g. fleur-de-lys, fleur-de-lis) but not all are shown here.
    * Plurals are also accepted where appropriate.
    * Use of a synonym does not (usually) change anything on the shield
  * Items in curly brackets are additional, optional terms
    * These terms appear _in addition to_ the preceeding word
    * They will cause a different appearance on the shield if they are present

Examples of actual blazonry are shown like this:

```
Azure - Example of a very simple shield
```

Where there are restrictions or issues they are discussed at the end of each page in the section titled _Points to Note_.

For the precise meaning of each term look them up in
[www.heraldsnet.org/saitou/parker/](http://www.heraldsnet.org/saitou/parker/). Where there is a difference between
French and British heraldic tradition I have followed the British
interpretation.
