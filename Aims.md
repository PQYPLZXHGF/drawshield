# Ultimate Aim #

To implement the whole of the book GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN HERALDRY
by JAMES PARKER such that any example blazon from the glossary will be correctly parsed and displayed.

## A Little History ##

Actually, that wasn't the original aim. Originally, this was just a fun programming project to put on my newly created web page. Back in 1984 I was doing a Computer Systems Engineering degree at the University of Kent at Canterbury. During the final year we had to complete a group project. One of our lecturers, Dr. David Wood suggested that a group of four students might wish to write a UCSD Pascal program to display shields in full colour on an Apple ][ computer. This is what we did, we all graduated succesfully!

25 years later I was creating a website to advertise my services as a freelance lecturer and wanted some interesting images to spice up my resume pages. Sadly, in the course of various house moves the screen dumps of those Apple ][ screens had been lost. No problem, I thought, I bet I could reproduce that UCSD Pascal program in a couple of days with PHP...

I reproduced everything that our original program could do, but just couldn't seem to stop. There was always some new feature to add, some new quirk of blazonry to implement. But when I reach the Ultimate Aim, then yes, I will stop and get on with something less all-consuming!

## Subsidiary Aims ##

  * Learning about and keeping current with modern programming languages and techniques
  * Learning about heraldry and blazonry
  * Creating some good heraldic artwork
  * Learning about and keeping current with modern integrated development environments
  * Conversing with interesting folks with similar interests
  * Setting challenges for myself and enjoying the satisfaction of achieving them!
