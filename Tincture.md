# Description #

A tincture is a single colour or a repeating pattern of two colours that can be applied to the whole shield or to some
item on the shield.

## The Tincture ##

A tincture can be any one of the following:

  * [Colour](Colour.md) - (A single colour)

  * [Fur](Fur.md) - (A repeating pattern with two, fixed colours)

  * [Treatment](Treatment.md) - (A repeating pattern in which both colours are provided in the blazon)

  * [Colour](Colour.md) **semy de** (**strewn with**) [charges](Charge.md) - (A single colour with small versions of the charge placed at regular intervals)

## Forward Reference ##

In most situations, if no tincture is found where one is expected then the program will look forward through
the blazon and use the next tincture that it finds. For example a list of charges can be given with the tincture
at the end. This is example of heralds avoiding repitition.

## Back References ##

A noted above, Heralds do not like to repeat themselves in a blazon and so will often use "back references" to previously used colours.
Wherever a tincture is expected it may be replaced by any of the following:

  * **Of the same** (**like** can be used instead of **of** throughout)
  * **Of the last**
  * **Of the first** (**of the 1st**)
  * **Of the second** (**of the 2nd**)
  * **Of the third** (**of the 3rd**)
  * **Of the fourth** (**of the 4th**)

Obviously it is an error if you refer to the third colour and have only used two so far.

# Points to Note #

There is an ambiguity with treatments and the meaning of **same** and **last**. For example in
```
azure, a base grillage azure and or and a chief of the same
```
should the chief be coloured **or** (the last colour mentioned) or should it be **grillage azure and or**
(the last tincture mentioned)? I have decided that **same** should mean the last tincture (i.e. the whole
treatment, if there is one) whilst **last** refers to the most recently mentioned [colour](Colour.md), even if
it is part of a treatment. I don't know whether this accords with heraldic practice, but there you go...
