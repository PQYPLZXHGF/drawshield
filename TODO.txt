TODO

Fix positions for in bend sinister, need to mirror bend positions in placement.inc

"an orle of" does not need tincture....

Indirection for modifier data? (mods repeat for each synonym) No they don't! But maybe combine things like couped...?

chevron quarterly - need to switch chevron quarterly x and y for chevron mod quarterly 
(Can body 2 use shape_spec to ensure wibbly edges? would need to transfer linetype also... )

Chevron - finish compony &counter comp for all variants (sob!)

Move all specific knowledge into "flags" (like $put_in_chief), do NOT rely on the NAME of the charge or ordinary

Re-implement "facing" mod

Non symmetical ordinaries MUST not extend beyond shield boundaries!! Need to check all - see quarter.inc BUT 
this breaks fimbriation if done by just using stroke-width. See issue 206 for possible solution - would this
work for variant linetypes...?

Need to check all COMPONY body2 overlap their ordinary so linetypes are correctly filled (see e.g. fess.inc)

azure a cartouche bendwise ermine - is not in the right place?

azure a cartouche in bend ermine - does not rotate fur properly

In ordinary.inc / charge.inc can we combine the mods array and inv, rot, rev to just use existing modifier nodes?

Properly document ordinary and charge

TEST EVERYTHING!!!

DONE

Do not repeat error messages (e.g. once per charge)

charge WITHIN ordinary (is same as WITHIN ordinary charge)

Bug fix, treatments were reversed if colour treatment colour

fix for ordinary reversed => ordinary inverted

Gules a Chevron Argent between in chief two Lozenges and in base a
Lion passant guardant Or. - Now parses correctly.

Better filling by division

The vairy treatment was very large, it has been reduced
