# Description #

In addition to be being drawn with variant edge types, ordinaries may also have other modifiers applied
which may affect how they are drawn, or their placement. They usually come between the ordinary and its tincture,
however there are some exceptions noted below.

## The Modifiers ##

The following modifiers, (which go after the ordinary) are available:

**voided**, **fimbriated** (**edged**), {**double**, **treble**} **cotised** (**endorsed**, **cotticed**),
**enhanced**, **abased**, **couped** {**in base**, **in chief**, **dexter**, **sinister**},
**lozengy**, **compony** (**gobony**), **counter compony**.

There are many quirks to each of these, which I have tried to capture in this table:

| **Modifier** | **Description** | **Tinctures** | **position** |
|:-------------|:----------------|:--------------|:-------------|
| voided       | Drawn in outline only | if followed by a tincture the interior is drawn that colour | follows the ordinary tincture |
| fimbriated   | Edges drawn in different colour | must be followed by a tincture | follows the ordinary tincture |
| cotised      | 1, 2 or 3 extra edges drawn | if followed by a tincture, extra edges drawn in that colour | follows the ordinary tincture, can also have their own variant line type, see below |
| enhanced, abased | moved up, down  | none          | before or after the ordinary |
| couped       | cut short (at a particular end) | none          | between the ordinary and its tincture |
| lozengy, compony, counter compony | filled with a fixed pattern | must be followed by two tinctures | follows the ordinary |

Cotticing can be quite complex, here are some examples:

There is also a modifier which goes before the ordinary:

**debruised** (**depressed**) **with** (**by** or **of**)

With this modifier the ordinary in question will be drawn on top of the previous charge or ordinary, (normally
ordinaries are drawn below charges). The ordinary will also have a thin black border to make it stand out.

# Points to Note #

There are many situations when combinations of modifiers, or modifiers and particular ordinaries
do not make sense. The program may ignore these or may draw strange things. If you stick to real
blazons then you should not come across these situations.
