Drawshield draws shields based on their "blazon", or heraldic description. The project consists of three main parts - a parser written in PHP which converts the blazon to an intermediate (XML) form; one or more backends, also PHP, which convert the intermediate form to a graphical representation (only SVG is provided at present); and a set of Javascript tools which demonstrate shield drawing, create random blazons, teach blazonry and implement a blazonry quiz. Drawshield can faithfully reproduce very complex blazons such as "Gules, on a bend or between two escallops argent a Cornish chough proper between as many cinquefoils azure; and on a chief of the second a rose of the first seeded gold and barbed vert between two fleur-de-lis of the field".
