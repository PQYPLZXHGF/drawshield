# Description #

Most divisions, and some of the larger ordinaries can be drawn with patterned
edges, rather than straight lines.

## Line Types ##

The variant line types available are:

**battled-embattled**, **battled-counter-embattled**, **dancetty**, **dancetty floretty**(1), **dovetailed**, **embattled**, **engrailed**, **indented**, **invected**, **nebuly**, **potenty**, **raguly**, **rayonny**, **urdy**, **wavy**, **angled**, **bevilled**, **escartelly**, **nowy**, **arched** (**enarched**), **double-arched**

# Points to Note #

There are some situations where these do not appear correctly on some shapes, for example, potenty and nebuly really only work on straight lines, I have not found a good design to get them round corners.

(1) Dancetty floretty is a large, fixed size pattern that should only be used on very large ordinaries or divisions, like bend, per fess and so on.
