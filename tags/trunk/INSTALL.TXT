Quick Installation Instructions
===============================

Place all drawshield files in a folder called 'shield' in your PHP include path
(e.g. /www/include/shield)

The main program is called 'drawshield.php', it is normally called via an HTTP
GET command with one argument "blazon", set to a URI encoded string containing
the blazon (shield description). The program will return an SVG representation
of the shield. For example:

GET /include/shield/drawshield?blazon=Azure%20a%20%bend%20or HTTP/1.1

Will return an SVG image (Content-Type: image/svg+xml) of a blue shield with a
yellow diagonal stripe.

Demonstration Page
==================

A simple demonstration page is provided as "shield/demopage.html". This uses
Javascript and AJAX to replace some inline SVG with the shield created from
the blazon typed into a text box. The Javascript assumes that the program
has been installed as above. Follow the comments in the html if your installation
path is different.
