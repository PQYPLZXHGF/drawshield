# Description #

Marshalling refers to the organisation of more than one blazon onto a single shield.

## Combining Two Shields ##

SimpleShield **dimididated with** SimpleShield

SimpleShield **impaled with** SimpleShield

## Combining Up to Four Shields ##

**Quartered** (**quarterly**) **first** (**1st**, **I**) SimpleShield **second** (**2nd**, **II**) SimpleShield
**third** (**3rd**, **III**) SimpleShield **fourth** (**4th**, **IV**) SimpleShield

You can combine quarters, e.g. **first and third** SimpleShield.

## Overall ##

Any [ordinaries](Ordinaries.md) or [charges](Charge.md) that are preceeded by **overall** will be placed
"on top" of anything else on the shield, i.e. without regard to anything else on the shield that
would normally cause adjustments.

# Points to Note #

There is an ambiguity with marshalled shields - if the blazon ends with something that is
**overall** does it refer to something over the last SimpleShield or over the whole of the combined
shields? Drawshield resolves this ambiguity by use of the ';' (semi-colon). If there is a semi-colon
before the word **overall** then the items are placed over the whole shield, otherwise the items will
be placed over the last SimpleShield.
