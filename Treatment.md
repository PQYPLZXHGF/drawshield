# Description #

Treatments are repeating patterns that have two tinctures. They can be applied to most things
but most commonly are found on the field or the larger ordinaries.

## The Treatments ##

The treatments (and some common alternative names) are:

**annuletty**, **billetty**, **billetty counter billetty**, **bezanty**, **checky**, **crusilly**,
**estoilly**, **fleury**, **fretty**, **goutty**,
**grillage**, **honeycombed**, **hurty**, **maily**, **masoned**, **mullety**, **papelonny**,
**platy**, **scaly**, **semy-de-lys**, **vairy**

# Points to Note #

In most cases treatments retain their orientation even if the object they are colouring is rotated
or inverted. There are a few exceptions, for example a treatment place on a bend will be turned so
the treatment is parallel to the bend.
