# Description #

Charges are pictures of physical objects or geometric shapes. Unlike [Ordinaries](Ordinaries.md) which are normally fixed
in size and position, you can have any number of charges and have a fair degree of freedom how these are
arranged and where on the shield they are placed.

There are as many charges as there are physical objects that we have names for. The program does not
implement them all.

## Available Charges ##

This is a temporary list of charges, in [alphabetical order](ChargeAlpha.md).

# Points to Note #

Some of the charges are not very good!
