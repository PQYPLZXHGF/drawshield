# Description #

Furs are repeating patterns that have two, fixed colours.

## The Furs ##

The furs (and some common alternative names) are:

**counter-ermine** (**ermines**), **counter-potent**, **counter-vair**, **ermine**, **erminois**, **pean**, **potent**,
**potent-counter-potent**, **vair**, **vair-en-point**, **vair-in-pale**

## Of ##

In all cases, the fur may optionally be preceeded by the word **of**.

# Points to Note #

In general, furs retain their orientation even if the item that they are colouring is rotated or
inverted. There are a few exceptions, for example, a fur placed on a bend will be turned to be parallel
with the bend.
