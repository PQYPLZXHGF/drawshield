# Random Shield Release Notes #

Versions are numbered in three levels, as follows:

  * The major version number, changes very infrequently
  * The minor version number, changes when the actual program code is altered in some way
  * The sub-version (a letter), changes when the data is changed, for example adding a new generation template
