# Different ways to place, orient and arrange charges
# Charge Arrangemements #

There are many ways in which charges can be placed on the field, indicated by
special heraldic terms. In most cases these terms can preceed or follow the charge,
where there is a particular restriction this is noted below.

## The Importance of Semicolons ##

Given the flexibility with which arrangements can be shown (before or after the charge)
there is a potential problem when there is more than one charge, for example in

**Azure the sun in splendour inverted in base a chalice or**

To which charge do the **inverted** and **in base** refer to? There are 3 potential
answers. Commas usually do not help, you will often find the blazon  above shown as something like:

**Azure, the sun in splendor, inverted, in base, a chalice or**

Which does not get us any further. If your blazon is not producing the output you expect your first step should be to put in semi-colons to clearly separate charges, for example:

**Azure, the sun in splendor; inverted in base, a chalice or**

# Size and Spacing #

By default, charges will be placed to occupy the bulk of the center of the shield, and if there are more
than 2 then they will be arranged in a symmetrical triangular pattern,
reducing in size as more are added. If a chief is
present the charges will be slightly smaller and moved down the shield.

## Size and Space Modifiers ##

The following modifiers may be used on charges, these must **follow** the charge name.

  * **entire** causes the charge(s) to occupy the whole of the field
  * By rows (e.g. **two, two and one**) specifies the number of charges on each row, from top to bottom
  * **conjoined**

# Charge Orientation #

Charges normally have a preferred orientation, typically upright and facing towards the dexter. This can be changed as shown below.

## Applicable to all Charges ##

The following terms apply equally to all charges
