TODO

demi lion not top half

Fix positions for in bend sinister, need to mirror bend positions in placement.inc

"an orle of" does not need tincture....

Move all specific knowledge into "flags" (like $put_in_chief), do NOT rely on the NAME of the charge or ordinary

Re-implement "facing" mod

Properly document ordinary and charge

cross-pierced cotticing

Allow ordinary['fim_path'] to be a path spec & use if present instead of body

split global.inc between parser and svg

Compony and counter compony for plain cross

per saltire with a chief should be non-45 degrees to look better?

doevtailed - make separate start and end paths to return to center? Complicated, but might make quarterly etc. look better (+issue 144)

fluery on each point (adds -floretty to dancetty line type)

rewrite calcPlace to use modifiers directly from node, not passed to it.

void version of fylfot and cross formy

Add ringed modifier to quadrates

placement for in pale when in bottom quarters ( see showcase 2 )

ordinaries with black furs should have white border?

in first and friends with a chief present

placements not carried forward? e.g. on a cross 4 pommes a chief gules

in svg/charge.inc call makeCharge early so that it can change any modifiers (so can move from rewriter.inc). Also get makeCharge to call its own placement()???

label  can be couped, have charges on each point, including a canton, can have 3 or 5 points

DONE

chargeA on chargeB means same as chargeB charged with chargeA (& on chargeB chargeA)
